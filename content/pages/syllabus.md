Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

Parallel treatments of photons, electrons, phonons, and molecules as energy carriers, aiming at fundamental understanding and descriptive tools for energy and heat transport processes from nanoscale continuously to macroscale. Topics include the energy levels, the statistical behavior and internal energy, energy transport in the forms of waves and particles, scattering and heat generation processes, Boltzmann equation and derivation of classical laws, deviation from classical laws at nanoscale and their appropriate descriptions, with applications in nano- and microtechnology.

Homework
--------

Students are required to complete weekly homework, due on the second session of each week. For graduate students: complete homework plus weekly paper reading. For undergraduate students: complete homework (sometimes less than graduate assignment) and no weekly paper report.

Grading
-------

There is no final exam.

For undergraduate Students: 10% Bonus will be given for undergraduate students following graduate assignments.
